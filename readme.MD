0) touch5 helps you quickly to create a html5 type of file on command line
1) Find the Node installation folder by running: *which node*
2) If the Node installation folder is not the same with the Shebang(!#) in
the estii file, change it
3) At the folder you copied the files run: *sudo npm link*
4) touch5 in now on /usr/local/bin/touch5 meaning it is global in
your system and available everywhere via command line
5) Testing: change the directory and run: *touch5 [somename].html*
If you can see *[somename].html* in the directory listing the touch5 did what
it was meant to do. You can view the new file and find it to be pure html5 file
